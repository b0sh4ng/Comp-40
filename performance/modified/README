Assignment 7 Profiling

We have recieved help from the Comp40 TA's, Noah Mendelson, and have
discussed optimized times/results with other students.

UM Analysis
The most costly procedure in the final, optimized version of the um is the 
routine of getting the next instruction in the array, routing that instruction
based on opcode, and passing the register values of that to the appropriate
instruction function. This process takes up approximately 60% of runtime.


Assembly code analysis
No information was gleaned from a brief analysis of the aseembly code of our 
final compilation. There were over 22 thousand instructions, preventing any
level of scrutiny. However, one interesting pattern found was that instructions
of the same opcode were often grouped in blocks of 10-20 when revealed by 
umdump. Our prediction is that because certain hardware circuits are used to 
deal with certain instructions, it is most efficient to access that hardware
repeatedly, e.g. in blocks of instructions, when possible.

Time Spent Analyzing Problems: 5 hours
Time Spent Solving Problems: 14 hours

The following files were used as benchmarks:
sandmark.umz (Big) 
advent.umz (Medium, run with partial solution)
midmark.um (Small)
