Aspects that have been implemented correctly:

        brightness.c
                *Given a pgm image file, brightness correctly calculates the 
                  average brightness and reports that value rounded to 3 
                  decimal places.
        
        readaline.c
                *Given a pointer to an open text file and a pointer to a pointer
                  to a block of memory, the program reads the next unread line
                  and stores the characters in a byte array.
                *The program then sets the given pointer to a pointer to the
                  array and returns the size of that array.
                *Sucessfully implements Hanson's Sequences in order to handle
                 lines of any length.

        simlines.c
                *Given one or more text files, the program finds lines that are
                  constructed of the same words and prints out where matches
                  occur and in which file.
                *Sucessfully implements Hanson's Sequences, Atoms and Tables to
                  detect and build match groups.
